* ###Problem  
  Create an exact copy of what the UI/X engineer designed for these 3 spotify screens by implementing their new UI design in TailwindCSS.
  These are the links to access the screens:
    * Home Screen: https://static.authw.it/000_Home_Screen.png
    * Playlist: https://static.authw.it/001_Playlist.png
    * Playlist Details: https://static.authw.it/001_Playlist_2.png
  
* ###Solution
  * Method  
    * We separated our project in 3. Each person had to work on 1 spotify page. I had to work on the "Playlist". 
    * Deboroh Prentice created the repository and I made a copy of it, cloned it, created my branch to work on my html page. I installed tailwind.
    * The final work is posted on vercel.
  * Process
    * Used PHPStorm
    * Used branching on GitHub
    * Used the CommandLine
    * Contributed the header and footer
  * Result + Demo 
    * [Spotify](https://spotifyuix.vercel.app/)
